                        Avorado was the final and biggest assignment during a one week long programming bootcamp. We had two days to make something in Processing, "that would make the teachers proud".
                        The opportunities were endless, since Processing offers a great variety of visual graphics and tools for creating (almost) anything one would want. However, since studying game development, I chose to create a game.
                        <br><br>
                        The initial idea was to create something fun, something that people (and myself as well) would enjoy playing. After trial and error with multiple styles, the two-player game, called avorado was born.

                    Processing allows a multiplayer aspect by using the keyboard and mouse input. That's how I dealt with creating this two-player game. The goal of the game is to compete against each other and try to catch as many avocado seeds as possible ("Help Alfred get his seeds together").
                    <br><br>
                    The mechanics may already be familiar to most of us, objects are getting spawned randomly and the player needs to catch it, if it misses, loses a life. This was the main base of my game as well, however, I've tried adding some extra things to it, to make it more fun and engaging.
                    <br><br>
                    This is how I have changed that seeds would get spawned on random places and would get a new random speed each time, making the game more challenging and giving it some variety.
                    What it could make the game even better is adding some power-ups that pop up randomly as well, either something that helps one player (like a shield, extra life etc) or that harms the other (making them either super slow or fast, partially blind or many more).

                            The duel between the two players can go on for quite a long time, depending on skills. For now, that player loses, who lost all of their lives, not based on score (this might need some balance maybe). An interesting thing was collision detection, which was achieved by a function namet get(x,y), which would get a colour number that an object is collided with.
                            Based on the returned colour, I could give certain instructions in the code.

                        Making the game was super fun. Not only I enjoyed creating it and playtesting it, but seeing my classmates and teachers enjoy it as much, or even more, as I do, was phenomenal.
                        After the bootcamp we had an expo, where 15+ people tried Avorado, and I have gotten lots of great feedback and happy faces. Definitely a proud avocado mama right here.
                        Additionally, while making the game, I have also helped my classmates who got stuck, with coding, which gave me a self-esteem boost and energy. I have really enjoyed it.
